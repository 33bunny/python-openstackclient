upgrade:
  -
    Changed the ``security group rule create`` command ``--src-ip``
    option to ``--remote-ip``, ``--src-group`` option to ``--remote-group``.
    Using the ``--src-ip`` ``--src-group`` option is still supported, but
    is no longer documented and may be deprecated in a future release.
