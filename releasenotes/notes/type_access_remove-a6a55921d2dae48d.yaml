    Added support for removing volume type access to project.

    By default, volumes types are public.
    To create a private volume type the ``--private`` option must be included
    in the ``volume type create`` command.

    To control access to a private volume type, user needs to add or remove
    access of a private volume type to project.

    This feature enables user to remove private volume type access to a
    project using below command:

    ``volume type unset --project <project> <volume_type>``
