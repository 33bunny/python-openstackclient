    Added support for setting volume type access to project.

    By default, volumes types are public.
    To create a private volume type, user needs to set is_public boolean
    field to false at volume type creation time.
    To control access to a private volume type, user needs to add access
    of a private volume type to project.

    So, this feature enables user to add private volume type access to a
    project using below command

    ``volume type set --project <project> <volume_type>``.
