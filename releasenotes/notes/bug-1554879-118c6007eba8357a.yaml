    Added ``--image-property`` option to ``volume unset`` command

    Image properties are copied from image when volume is created.
    But since a volume is mutable, user sometime wants to delete
    image properties for volume.

    So, this fix enables user to delete image properties of volume
    using below command:
    ``volume unset  [--image-property <key>] <volume>``.
