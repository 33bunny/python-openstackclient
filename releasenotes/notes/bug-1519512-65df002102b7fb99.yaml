features:
  - The ``security group rule list`` command now uses Network v2
    when enabled which results in ``egress`` security group rules
    being displayed. In addition, security group rules for all
    projects will be displayed when the ``group`` argument is not
    specified (admin only).

fixes:
  - The ``security group rule list`` command no longer ignores
    the ``group`` argument when it is set to an empty value.
