    Added support for system-scope. This includes support for the ability to
    generate system-scoped tokens using ``system_scope: all`` in ``cloud.yaml``
    or ``OS_SYSTEM_SCOPE=all`` in an environment variable. Support is also
    included for managing role assignments on the system using ``--system``
    when adding and removing roles.
