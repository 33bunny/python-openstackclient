    Support list commands by group name keyword. Add ``--group`` option to
    filter the commands by group name keyword, like: --group volume, list all
    openstack.volume.v2 (cinder) commands.
    That support the scenario that users need to know the current support
    commands of some OpenStack services(nova, neutron, cinder and so on) in
    OSC, and make it easier for users to find out the related commands that
    they care about.
